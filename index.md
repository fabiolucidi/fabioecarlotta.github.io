  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    The first time I saw him, we were both sitting at the same gate for a flight to San Diego. I remember glancing over at him and thinking, Oh, wow, he’s cute. When I got to my seat, I saw that the seat beside me was empty and thought, how awesome would it be if he ended up next to me?

Well, he did. We started talking, and then he asked for my number and we went our separate ways. I was certain I would never hear from him again. I thought about him often, but eventually he faded into the ‘missed connections’ category. A few months later, out of the blue, he sent me [a message that said] ‘Happy New Year.’ We hit it off like nothing ever changed.

There a lots of ways to get in downtown! There are several car rental options, and Lyft and Uber are relatively inexpensive. If you are feeling more adventurous, the light rail is only a few dollars to downtown Seattle!
